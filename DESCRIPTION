Title: Assigning metabolic rate measurements to torpor and euthermia in heterothermic endotherms  
Version: 0.1.1

             family = "Vullioud",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: This package enables an objective and standardized distinction 
    between torpid and euthermic metabolic rates (M) measured in steady-state 
    conditions. Furthermore, it provides parametersâ€™ estimations of the relation 
    between ambient temperatures (Ta) and M in both physiological stages. This 
    package is aimed to support any physiologist working in thermal energetics. 
    More information can be found on the companion article Fasel et al. (in prep).
