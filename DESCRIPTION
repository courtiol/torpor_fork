Title: Fit Torpor Models For Bats
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Colin Vullioud, Nicolas Fasel

Description: This package enables an objective and standardized distinction 
  between torpid and euthermic metabolic rates (MR) measured in steady-state 
  conditions. Furthermore, it provides parameters’ estimations of the relation
  between ambient temperatures (Ta) and MR in both physiological stages. This 
  package is aimed to support any physiologist working in thermal energetics. 
  More information can be found on the companion article Fasel et al. (in prep).
  This R package is centered around the "standard" relationship between MR and Ta 
  modelled by Humphries et al. (2002) and Speakman and Thomas (2003) for bats. 
  The model additionally considers a potential metabolic inhibition during torpor 
  (Geiser 2004, Withers et al. 2016). Predictions and function parameters are
  estimated with a binary mixture model using Bayesian inference.
  Note: This package is not aimed for general use without careful researcher’s 
  attention. Several elements of consideration are discussed in Fasel et al. (in prep).
