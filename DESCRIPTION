Description: This package enables an objective and standardized distinction 
             between torpid and euthermic metabolic rates (MR) measured in steady-state 
             conditions. Furthermore, it provides parametersâ€™ estimations of the relation 
             between ambient temperatures (Ta) and MR in both physiological stages. 
             This package is aimed to support any physiologist working in thermal energetics.
