Description: This package enables an objective and standardized distinction 
    between torpid and euthermic metabolic rates (MR) measured in steady-state 
    conditions. Furthermore, it provides parametersâ€™ estimations of the relation 
    between ambient temperatures (Ta) and MR in both physiological states. This 
    package is aimed to support any physiologist working in thermal energetics. 
    More information can be found on the companion article Fasel et al. (in prep).
