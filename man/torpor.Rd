\title{torpor: Binary mixture model aimed at distinguishing torpid and
euthermic metabolic rates}
\description{
This package enables an objective and standardized distinction between torpid
and euthermic metabolic rates (M) measured in steady-state conditions.
Furthermore, it provides parametersâ€™ estimations of the relation between
ambient temperatures (Ta) and MR in both physiological stages. This package
is aimed to support any physiologist working in thermal energetics. More information
can be found on the compagnon article Fasel et al. (in prep) and in the vignettes.
}
\details{
This package is center around the \code{\link[=tor_fit]{tor_fit()}} function which
allows to fit binary mixture model on metabolic rates data using Bayesian inference.

\section{tor_fit}{

The function \code{\link[=tor_fit]{tor_fit()}} considers the assumed relation between
metabolic rate (M) and ambient temperature (Ta) (Speakman & Thomas 2003).In the hypothermic state (torpor) and above some threshold Ta (Tmin),
M follows an exponential curve reflecting the Arrhenius rate enhancing
effect of temperature on chemical reactions, whereas below Tmin, it increases
linearly with decreasing Ta to maintain a minimal Tb in torpor. In the
euthermic state, M solely increases linearly with decreasing Ta.

\section{tor_plot}{

The function \code{\link[=tor_plot]{tor_plot()}} is a wrapper function around the [tor_fit())] and [tor_predict()].
It uses [tor_fit()] to fit a binomial mixture model using
Bayesian inference and plot the predicted value as well as the raw data.
Measures are presented in different colors depending of the metabolic state.
Predicted values as well as 95\% credibility interval (segmented lines)
are also presented. This function enable the user to replicates the analysis done in
Fasel et al. (in prep).

[tor_predict()]: R:tor_predict()

}

\section{tor_predict}{

The function provides the predicted M and 95\% credible interval boundaries
at a defined Ta given a certain model, in normothermic and/or torpid stage.
}

\section{tor_classify}{

The function classify the individual points according to their estimated state.
}

\section{tor_summarise}{

The function gives a summary statistics of the model fit.
